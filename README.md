# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Customer-on-Amazon-Dataset
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used in order to analyze the sentiment of the customer based on his product reviews. convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of ​ Supervised deep neural networks​ , most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery and text classification. RNN is also one of the Supervised Deep Neural Networks which can be used to analyze the sentiments of the customer. Many-to-One Model is the RNN architecture used for Sentimental Analysis.

Customer reviews about the products were obtained from the amazon website as a complete dataset
which consists of ​ 3.6 Million Texts (Customer Reviews on the Products )​ and the class labels either 0 or 1
resulting in Negative and Positive Sentiments of the Customer on the product.

The Natural Language Part required to analyze the sentiments of the customer was implemented by using
the Deep Learning Natural Language Processing framework ​ Tensorflow. ​ Other Frameworks Such as NLTK,
Pytorch, Theono can also be used, but Tensorflow provides higher computational efficiency and Flexibility
then other NLP frameworks.
